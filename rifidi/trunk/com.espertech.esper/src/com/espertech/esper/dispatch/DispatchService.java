package com.espertech.esper.dispatch;

/**
 * Service for dispatching internally (for operators/views processing results of prior operators/views) and
 * externally (dispatch events to UpdateListener implementations).
 * The service accepts Dispatchable implementations to its internal and external lists.
 * When a client invokes dispatch the implementation first invokes all internal Dispatchable
 * instances then all external Dispatchable instances. Dispatchables are invoked
 * in the same order they are added. Any dispatchable added twice is dispatched once.
 *
 * <p>Note: Each execution thread owns its own dispatch queue.
 *
 * Note: Dispatchs could result in further call to the dispatch service. This is because listener code
 * that is invoked as a result of a dispatch may create patterns that fireStatementStopped as soon as they are started
 * resulting in further dispatches within the same thread. Thus the implementation class must be careful
 * with the use of iterators to avoid ConcurrentModificationException errors.
