import java.util.Iterator;

/**
 * A concurrency-safe iterator that iterates over events representing statement results (pull API)
 * in the face of concurrent event processing by further threads.
 * <p>
 * In comparison to the regular iterator, the safe iterator guarantees correct results even
 * as events are being processed by other threads. The cost is that the iterator holds
 * one or more locks that must be released via the close method. Any locks are acquired
 * at the time an instance is created.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: An application MUST explicitly close the safe iterator instance using the close method, to release locks held by the
 * iterator. The call to the close method should be done in a finally block to make sure
 * the iterator gets closed.
 * <p>
 * Multiple safe iterators may be not be used at the same time by different application threads.
 * A single application thread may hold and use multiple safe iterators however this is discouraged.
