/**
 * Plug-in event representation that can dynamically create event types and event instances based on
 * information available elsewhere.
 * <p>
 * A plug-in event representation can be useful when your application has existing Java classes that carry
 * event metadata and event property values and your application does not want to (or cannot) extract or transform
 * such event metadata and event data into one of the built-in event representations (POJO Java objects, Map or XML DOM).
 * <p>
 * Further use of a plug-in event representation is to provide a faster or short-cut access path to event data.
 * For example, the access to XML event data through a StAX Streaming API for XML (StAX) is known to be very efficient.
 * <p>
 * Further, a plug-in event representation can provide network lookup and general abstraction of event typing and
 * event sourcing.
 * <p>
 * Before use, an implementation of this interface must be registered via configuration. Upon engine initialization,
 * the engine invokes the {@link #init} method passing configuration information.
 * <p>
 * When a plug-in event type name is registered via configuration (runtime or configuration time), the
 * engine first asks the implementation whether the type is accepted via {@link #acceptsType}.
 * If accepted, the engine follows with a call to {@link #getTypeHandler} for creating and handling the type.
 * <p>
 * An implementation can participate in dynamic resolution of new (unseen)
 * event type names if the application configures the URI of the event representation, or a child URI (parameters possible) via
 * {@link com.espertech.esper.client.ConfigurationOperations#setPlugInEventTypeResolutionURIs(java.net.URI[])}.
 * <p>
 * Last, see {@link com.espertech.esper.client.EPRuntime#getEventSender(java.net.URI[])}. An event sender
 * allows dynamic reflection on an incoming event object. At the time such an event
 * sender is obtained and a matching URI specified, the {@link #acceptsEventBeanResolution} method
 * indicates that the event representation can or cannot inspect events, and the {@link PlugInEventBeanFactory}
 * returned is used by the event sender to wrap event objects for processing.
