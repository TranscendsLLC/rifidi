     * in the face of concurrent event processing by further threads.
     * <p>
     * In comparison to the regular iterator, the safe iterator guarantees correct results even
     * as events are being processed by other threads. The cost is that the iterator holds
     * one or more locks that must be released via the close method. Any locks are acquired
     * at the time this method is called.
     * <p>
     * This method is a blocking method. It may block until statement processing locks are released
     * such that the safe iterator can acquire any required locks.
     * <p>
     * An application MUST explicitly close the safe iterator instance using the close method, to release locks held by the
     * iterator. The call to the close method should be done in a finally block to make sure
     * the iterator gets closed.
     * <p>
     * Multiple safe iterators may be not be used at the same time by different application threads.
     * A single application thread may hold and use multiple safe iterators however this is discouraged.
     * @return safe iterator; NOTE: Must use the close method to close the safe iterator, preferably in a finally block
