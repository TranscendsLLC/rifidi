/**
 * This interface provides metadata on events.
 * <p>
 * The interface exposes events as organizations of named values.
 * The contract is that any event in the system must have a name-based way of accessing sub-data within its
 * event type. A simple example is a Java bean: the names can be property names, and those properties can have still
 * more properties beneath them. Another example is a Map structure. Here string names can refer to data objects.
 * <p>
 * The interface presents an immutable view of events. There are no methods to change property values.
 * Events by definition are an observation of a past occurrance or state change and may not be modified. 
 * <p>
 * Information on the super-types (superclass and interfaces implemented by JavaBean events) is also available,
 * for Java POJO events as well as for Map event types that has supertypes.
 * <p>
 * Implementations provide metadata on the properties that an implemenation itself provides.
 * <p>
 * Implementations also allow property expressioms that may use nested, indexed, mapped or a combination
 * of these as a syntax to access property types and values.
 * <p>
 * Implementations in addition may provide a means to access property values as event fragments, which
 * are typed events themselves.
