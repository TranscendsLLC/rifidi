/**
 * Extension of the {@link Ordered} interface, expressing a <em>priority</em>
 * ordering: order values expressed by {@code PriorityOrdered} objects
 * always apply before same order values expressed by <em>plain</em>
 * {@link Ordered} objects.
 *
 * <p>This is primarily a special-purpose interface, used for objects where
 * it is particularly important to recognize <em>prioritized</em> objects
 * first, without even obtaining the remaining objects. A typical example:
 * prioritized post-processors in a Spring
 * {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext}.
 *
 * <p>Note: {@code PriorityOrdered} post-processor beans are initialized in
 * a special phase, ahead of other post-processor beans. This subtly
 * affects their autowiring behavior: they will only be autowired against
 * beans which do not require eager initialization for type matching.
