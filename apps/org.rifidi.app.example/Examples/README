Move the "Examples" folder to the applications directory to demonstrate how properties work. 
The folder is called 'Examples' which is the group name for both applications. 

Each application will use two property files: one called Examples.properties, 
and another called <appname>.properties.

Notice there is a directory called 'readzones'. This folder lets you create readzone
property files which your applications can read in.

There is also a directory called 'data'. This folder contains files of any type that your 
application can read in.
